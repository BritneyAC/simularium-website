# Simularium Website

Front end website to create, modify and view simulations

---

## Description

â€‹This project aims to involve the wider biology community, especially wet lab biologists, in building and analyzing spatial mechanistic simulations at different levels of scale and connecting them in the context of whole cells. Our goal is to facilitate collaboration between experimental and computational biologists by building software tools and infrastructure to allow easy access to software packages written by computational biologists and easy visualization and sharing of results.

## Documentation

If you have more extensive technical documentation (whether generated or not), ensure they are published to the following address:
For full package documentation please visit
[organization.github.io/projectname](https://organization.github.io/projectname/index.html).

## Quick Start
To run this application in development: 
#### With Gradle
1. `$ ./gradlew start`

#### With npm
1. `npm i` to install dependencies 
2. `npm start`

This will start `webpack-dev-server`, running by default
on the port specified in `webpack/constants.js`. To view, visit `http://localhost:{PORT}`. Webpack-dev-server will watch all relevant project files, and reload the browser automatically when those files change.

## Development

1. Checkout a branch named for an issue/bug
2. Push changes to that branch
3. Make sure `npm run typeCheck`, `npm run test` and `npm run lint` all exit without errors. 
4. Make a PR back to master using template, include screen shots for visual changes. Request reviews from Megan, Dan, Eric, Blair. If your change is implementing a design add Lisa S too. 
5. Merge after at least 1 approval, but for complex changes, ideally 2.

### Runtime configuration:

| Env var | Default | Options |
| ------- |-------- |---------|
|`DEPLOYMENT_ENV`    | dev     | "dev", "staging", "production" |


Differences in builds by environment:

| Target | Sources Maps | Uglification | NODE_ENV === 'production' |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ |  ------------------------- |
| dev    | true         | false |  false                     |
| staging| true         | false |  false                      |
| production| false      | true |  true                      |

### Publishing
By default, Jenkins will build both a gzipped tar archive of all Webpack outputs (e.g., index.html, bundle.js, bundle.css; "build artifacts")
and a Docker image running an Nginx server, serving those same build artifacts.

### Docker image configuration
| Env var | Required | Default | Notes |
| ------- |-------- |---------|---------|
| `PORT` | - | 80 | Port on which the app will run **inside** the container. |
